Rawr 2 iOS Application

This is a turn-based game where you choose 1 of 4 attacks and your enemy attacks back. The power of the attack for both the enemy and player are randomized so the damage is not always the same. You go back and forth until someone dies. When the enemy is killed you receive gold based on what enemy it was. You are then taken to a screen where you can buy power ups that help you kill enemies. Once you hit continue you can start the next level. The enemies continue to get harder as the level gets higher. The players are animated for breathing and when they die. The high score is also saved through NSUserDefaults. Every 5 levels you are presented with an in-game mini-game where you play rock, paper, scissors with an enemy. If you win you get 20 extra coins, but if you lose you get nothing. When you die you are presented with a death screen to restart which has a quote of the day that is pulled in using an API.
